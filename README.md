## The Benefits of OpenC2 (Open Command and Control) in Cyberspace Defense.


*OpenC2 is a standardized language for the command and control of technologies that provide or support cyberspace defense. OpenC2 normalizes command and control, making it vendor and application-agnostic, enabling interoperability across cyber security tools and applications.*

### Benefits Catalogue
- OpenC2 is an Open Standard.

- OpenC2 standardizes the way we command and control technologies that provide or support cyberspace defense. This is achieved via the definition of Actuator Profiles (AP) that enumerate the combination of action/target pairs pertinent to cybersecurity-related functions (e.g., packet filtering, endpoint response, analytics).

- OpenC2 abstracts/normalizes command and control using a cyberdefense function-centric approach.

- OpenC2 supports machine-to-machine communication.

- OpenC2 enables interoperability across technologies that provide or support cyberspace defense. 

- OpenC2 reinforces integrated defense (security orchestration and automation) by enabling a plug-and-play approach to product integration.

- OpenC2 replaces proprietary (vendor-gnostic) command and control languages used in the definition of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

- OpenC2 mitigates the existing vendor lock-in problem pertinent to security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) that relies on the integration of proprietary APIs.

- OpenC2 is a fundamental component to enabling the sharing of machine-readable actions since it standardizes the language that can be used for communicating the information across or within organizational boundaries.

- OpenC2 is a fundamental component for creating and sharing vendor-agnostic executable security playbooks (course of action playbooks) across or within organizational boundaries since it can enable interoperability at the command level of a playbook.
